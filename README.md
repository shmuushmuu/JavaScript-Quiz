## Description of Project
The project was to make a quiz that a user would interact with. The quiz would start,
the timer would tick down, and the user would try to answer as many questions as they could, quickly and accurately.
The script would ask for their initials and log their score in local storage. If they answered questions incorrectly,
they would suffer a time penalty.

This project was hard. I did not finish it in the allotted time. I'm submitting what I have, and will return with many questions.

## Visuals
The website should look like this:
